Imagine that you are a tourist and you have to navigate the subway network in an unfamiliar town.
In each round, you will have to navigate from a starting station to a goal station.
Please try to plan your trip as quickly as possible.
During your trip, you will see the name of the current station and its neighboring stations in all four directions.
If there is no neighboring station in a particular direction, there will be a circle instead of a station name.
You can go north by pressing H, west by pressing F, south by pressing S, and east by pressing G.
When you reach the goal station, press T to end the round and start the next round.
