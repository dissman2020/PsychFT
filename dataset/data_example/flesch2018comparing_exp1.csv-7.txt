You are going to plant trees in two different gardens labeled North and South.
The trees look different from each other regarding their leafiness and branchiness.
There are 5 levels of leafiness (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) and 5 levels of branchiness (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
In each round, you get presented with a tree.
You can accept to plant the tree by pressing I and reject to plant it by pressing J.
If you accept to plant the tree and your answer is correct, you will be rewarded with points, otherwise, you will lose some points.
If you reject to plant the tree, you will not be rewarded (0 points).
Your task is to learn which type of tree grows best in each garden.
During the training phase, there will be feedback on every trial about your decisions.
During the testing phase, there will be no feedback for your decision.
