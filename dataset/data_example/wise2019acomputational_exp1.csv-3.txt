You are going to predict the probability of electric shocks associated with two visual stimuli.
First, you will have to indicate the probability that a stimulus predicts a shock at the current moment in time on a rating bar (between 0 and 100 percent).
After that, the outcome for each stimulus will be presented visually.
An upcoming shock will be indicated by a square over the stimulus, while a no-shock outcome will be indicated by a circle.
Finally, shocks will be delivered after you have learned about the outcome visually.
If both stimuli indicate a shock, they will be presented one after the other in random order.
The shock probability fluctuates over time such that one stimulus has a stable probability while the other varies.
