You are presented with a series of stimuli, each associated with one of three possible responses.
Your goal is to learn which response is the correct one for each stimulus.
When a stimulus is presented, you can press one of three keys to respond.
The three responses available are I, T, and Z.
After your response, you will receive feedback: 1 point for a correct response, or 0 points for an incorrect response.
The correct response for one stimulus does not inform you about the correct response for another stimulus.
You will play 13 games, each with a different mapping from stimuli to responses.
