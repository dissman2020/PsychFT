In this task, you have to repeatedly choose between two slot machines labeled T and Y.
You can choose a slot machine by pressing its corresponding key.
When you select one of the machines, you will win or lose points.
Machine T will not always give you the same points when you select it again, but machine Y will always give 0 points when you select it.
