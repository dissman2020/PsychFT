You will have to repeatedly feed animals with fruits.
Each fruit contains two vitamins.
Every animal has a different preference for the vitamins.
The vitamin contents and the preferences are both given as vectors with two entries.
Your points are calculated as the dot product of the vitamin content with the preference of the current animal.
For example, let us assume that you have to feed the elephant who has a preference [-1  1].
Then, if you feed the elephant a fruit with vitamin content [-1  1], this would yield 2 points.
If you feed it a fruit with vitamins [1 0], this would yield -1 points.
You have to buy the fruits in a market, in which you can go left or right for two steps.
You can press A to go left, and I to go right.
Per round, you always collect two fruits.
There are eight animals in total and you have to feed one, two, or three of them in each block.
In each block, there are twelve trials with different animals in blocked order.
After these twelve trials, there are three more in which you have to feed new animals.
The fruits in the market are rearranged after each block, meaning that you have to relearn the positions.
Your goal is to maximize the points obtained.

A new block starts. The locations of the fruits in the market got scrambled.
