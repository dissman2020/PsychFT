You will explore a castle, walking from room to room.
In each room, you will find different amounts of resources: wood, stone, and iron.
In each room, there are three doors that lead to different rooms.
The doors are labeled B, N, and Z.
You have to choose the right doors to find the most valuable resources.
You choose a door by pressing the corresponding key.
At the beginning of each round, you will be shown how valuable the resources are.
These values are given as market prices for wood, stone, and iron.
Multiplying the prices with the amounts of resources and adding them up yields a reward.
You want to maximize the cumulative reward.
After every round, you will start in room 0 again and see the new market prices.
