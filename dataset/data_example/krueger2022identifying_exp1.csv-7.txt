You will play multiple rounds of a gambling game.
In each round, you will be presented with 6 different gambles labeled: O, S, W, G, M, and P.
You will have to choose one of the gambles and receive a payoff for doing so.
The payoff you receive depends on both the gamble you choose and also the color of a ball we pull out of a jar with 100 colored balls.
There are a different number of balls of each color on every round.
The colors with more balls are more likely to be chosen.
Before making your choice, you may check how much different gambles are worth for different ball colors.
Each time you check a gamble will cost you 2 points.
To choose or check a gamble, first press the corresponding key, followed by typing "stop" (for choosing) or the ball color you would like to check.
