Each day you will either be presented with spaceships V and X or with spaceships M and D.
These spaceships will take you to two different planets Z and P.
You can take a spaceship by pressing the corresponding key.
Each planet has one alien on it and each alien has its own space treasure mine.
When you arrive at a planet, you will ask the alien for space treasure from its mine.
When you ask the alien, you will find out whether you got space treasure.
However, sometimes the alien's mine will dig up antimatter.
Antimatter is bad because each piece will destroy a piece of space treasure, reducing the total amount of treasure that you have.
The quality of each alien's mine will change during the game.
Your goal is to get as much treasure and as little antimatter as possible over the next 125 days.
