This experiment is composed of three parts.
In each round of the first part, you have to choose between one of two options represented by letters.
In a given pair, one option is, on average, more advantageous compared to the other.
You can win or lose the following outcomes: 1.0 points and -1.0 points.
In the second part, there will be two types of options.
The first type of option is represented by the letters you already encountered during the previous part.
Note that the options maintain the same odds of winning or losing a point as in the first part.
The second type of option is represented by an explicit description of the odds of winning or losing a point.
In each round of the third part, you will be presented with the options you met in the first and the second part.
This is the occasion to test your knowledge of each options's outcome.
You will be asked to indicate (in percentages), what are the odds that a given option makes you win a point.
You can choose an option by pressing its corresponding key.
Your goal for the first two parts is to maximize the amount of received points.
Your goal in the third part is to guess as accurately as possible.
