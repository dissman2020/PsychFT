In this experiment, you will go through three cycles of three tasks.
Each cycle concerns itself with a list of 30 word pairs for you to study.
In the first task of each cycle, you will go through the list.
You need to remember the word pairs indicated by a blue border.
For each word pair, please make a judgement on whether the object on the left is larger or smaller than the object on the right, and press the key "V" if the object on the left is larger, and the key "F" if it is smaller instead.
In the second task of each cycle, you will try to solve as many arithmetic equations as you can in one minute.
In the third task of each cycle, you will recall the words that you memorized in the first task of that cycle.
