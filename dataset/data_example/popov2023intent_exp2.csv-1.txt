In this experiment, you will go through three cycles of three tasks.
Each cycle concerns itself with a list of 30 words for you to study.

You need to remember the words indicated by a blue border.
For each word, please make a judgement on whether the object is larger or smaller than a football, and press the key "C" if the object is larger than a football, and the key "H" if it is smaller instead.
In the second task of each cycle, you will try to solve as many arithmetic equations as you can in one minute.
In the third task of each cycle, you will recall the words that you memorized in the first task of that cycle.
