Your task is to estimate the blood concentration of the hormone Caldionine based on information about the amount of two other hormones, Progladine and Amalydine, in multiple individuals' urine.
Both Progladine and Amalydine can take five values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
Caldionine can take nine values (extremely low, very low, low, somewhat low, normal, somewhat high, high, very high, extremely high).
Your goal is to estimate the concentration of Caldionine correctly.
You will receive feedback about the actual concentration after making your estimate.
This feedback will stop at some point.
