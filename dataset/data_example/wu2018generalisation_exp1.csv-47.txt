You will be presented with a series of 16 different environments to explore.
In each trial, you can select an option between numbers 1 and 30 by pressing the corresponding key.
By selecting any of these options, you will earn points associated with each unique option.
Imagine these options 1 through 30 as lying next to each other in an ordered line; options closer to each other tend to have similar rewards as rewards tend to cluster together.
For each environment, you will be able to make either 5 or 10 choices.
When you made all your choices in a given environment, you will start making choices in the next unexplored environment.
The rewards underlying the different options are different in each environment so you will learn them anew for each environment.
Each environment starts with the value of a single option revealed.
When you choose the number corresponding to a different option, you will be told the value of that option and receive those points.
Previously revealed options, including the starting option, can also be reselected, although there may be small changes in the point value.
It is your task to gain as many points as possible across all 16 environments.
